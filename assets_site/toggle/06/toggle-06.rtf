The 'Pink Toggle' is much more than a simple switch on your interface. Clicking on this toggle, the icon, which is not just an icon but an expression of style, magically transforms into a vibrant shade of pink. This subtle yet charming touch is not just a color change; it's a visual experience that captivates the user's eyes.\
The usability of the Pink Toggle is designed with the user in mind. The color change is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. The chosen shade of pink has been carefully selected to ensure a pleasant contrast along with legibility and the visual context of the interface. Offering functionality not only adds an attractive visual element but also ensures that the user immediately understands the change in state.\
